We aim to make “the DNA mag-beads” that 3-dimentional structure can be controlled by DNA and magnetic force on nanoscale. 

A DNA mag-bead is a magnetic bead that is attached by 2 kinds of DNA added cvU (Carboxyvinyl uracil) on each hemisphere. 

This DNA mag-beads can join together in a straight line by complementary binding 

of DNA with cvU attached on both hemispheres of bead. It is also possible to make high precision sheets or 3-dimentional structures by joining strings made from DNA mag-beads. 

We can control 3-dimentional structure and localization of magnetic beads by applying a magnetic field from the outside because DNA mag-beads use magnetic beads. 

It is possible to break only optional bonding when high frequency is applied to the magnetic beads and beads become at a high temperature.
